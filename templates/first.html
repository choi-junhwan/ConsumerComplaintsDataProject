	  The most frequently complained product is "Mortgage" in general.
	  The complaints, related with "Credit report" and "Debt collection", continuously increase.
	  This increase may be related with an aftermess of credit crisis.<br>
	  However, this analysis only takes account of total complaint number, not rate!
	  It could cause a strong bias toward the popular products.
	  I need to total sales of the products to get better measure.
